# Product Context: Document Assistant MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists

Developers and knowledge workers need efficient ways to manage documents, notes, and information across projects. While many tools exist, integrating document management directly into AI workflows through MCP enables seamless context sharing and automated knowledge management.

## Problems It Solves

### Problem 1: Scattered Documentation
**Current State**: Documents scattered across file systems with no centralized search
**Solution**: Centralized indexing system with tag-based organization

### Problem 2: Manual Knowledge Management
**Current State**: Manual file organization and searching
**Solution**: Automated indexing with metadata extraction and intelligent search

### Problem 3: Limited AI Context
**Current State**: AI assistants can't easily access and search project documents
**Solution**: MCP integration allows Cline direct access to document tools

### Problem 4: Note-Taking Friction
**Current State**: Creating and organizing notes requires context switching
**Solution**: Streamlined note creation with automatic indexing and tagging

## How It Should Work

### User Experience

#### Creating a Note
1. User invokes `create_note` tool through Cline
2. Provides title, content, and optional tags
3. System creates markdown file with frontmatter
4. Document automatically indexed for future search
5. User receives path to created note

#### Indexing a Document
1. User provides path to existing document
2. System reads file and extracts metadata
3. Tags applied for organization
4. Document added to searchable index
5. Confirmation returned with document ID

#### Searching Documents
1. User provides search query and optional tag filters
2. System searches indexed documents
3. Results ranked by relevance
4. Metadata returned for each match
5. User can refine search with additional filters

#### Extracting Metadata
1. User provides document path
2. System retrieves or extracts metadata
3. File information and indexed data returned
4. User gains insight into document properties

### Integration Pattern

```
User → Cline → MCP Client → Document Assistant Server → File System
                                        ↓
                                  JSON Index
                                        ↓
                                    Response
```
