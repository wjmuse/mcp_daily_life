# Current Sprint Rules

## Sprint Goal

Implement a minimal working MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for document processing, note-taking, and knowledge management.

## Current Focus

- Building core MCP server infrastructure
- Implementing basic document processing tools
- Setting up memory bank for knowledge storage
- Creating minimal working examples

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Complete MCP server implementation
- [ ] Implement document indexing tool
- [ ] Implement note-taking tool
- [ ] Set up memory bank structure

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add document format conversion
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add basic error handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Improve documentation

## Technical Decisions

### MCP Server Framework
- Using Python with MCP SDK
- Async/await pattern for tool execution
- JSON-based communication protocol

### Document Processing
- Support for markdown, text, and basic formats
- Metadata extraction and indexing
- Simple storage using file system

### Memory Bank
- Follow Cline Memory Bank guidelines
- Organize knowledge by categories
- Use markdown format for storage

## Blockers

None currently identified.

## Notes

- Keep implementation simple and focused on core functionality
- Prioritize working example over feature completeness
- Follow established coding standards from 01-coding.md
- Maintain documentation as per 02-documentation.md
